School tasks + self-study

1. <a href="https://github.com/MiddleZwei/Tools-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/kNN/Iris-Flowers">kNN - k Nearest Neighbors</a> <br>
Used to identify the closest k elements

2. <a href="https://github.com/MiddleZwei/Tools-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Perceptron">Perceptron</a><br>
A binary classifier specifying to which class elements belong

3. <a href="https://github.com/MiddleZwei/Tools-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Speech/SpeechRecognition">Speech Recognition</a><br>
Google Speech Recognition library

4. <a href="https://github.com/MiddleZwei/Tools-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/NeuralNet/Language-Recognition">NN to recognize language</a><br>
A neural net telling us which language a specific file is written in. It finds patterns in numbers of occurences of every letter in each language

5. <a href="https://github.com/MiddleZwei/Tools-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/K-means">k-means algorithm</a><br>
Creating clusters of elements around k centroids

6. <a href="https://github.com/MiddleZwei/Tools-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Naive-Bayes">Naive-Bayes algorithm</a><br>
Classify cars using Naive-Bayes' theorem

7. <a href="https://github.com/MiddleZwei/Tools-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/Knapsack">Knapsack problem</a><br>
A classic knapsack problem - Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
<i>Binary vector has been used to make it more efficient</i>

8. <a href="https://github.com/MiddleZwei/Tools-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/EfficientKnapsack">Efficient knapsack</a><br>
The same as 7., but in Java
